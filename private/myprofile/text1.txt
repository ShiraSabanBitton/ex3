I remember the first time I met Po the Tubby Dog. Po looked so cuddly as they sat beside me in the Tubbytronic Superdome. I slowly explained everything about the Tubby Custard mishap, and Po listened intently, their Tubby eyes filled with understanding. The pauses were comforting, and then it happened. I spotted the missing Tubby Custard ingredient. Po saved me from a tubby-tastrophe. - Sofia H, Teletubbyland Adventurer.
