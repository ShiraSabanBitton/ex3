Tinky Winky, my best friend
Many Teletubbies have heard of Tubby Custard Debugging. But they do not know the invincible power of a Debug Dog. Tubby Dogs are known in Teletubbyland as Tubby's best friends. Most Tubby cultures rate these magical creatures as above average intelligence, making them especially good at helping to debug those tough problems in your Tubby code.
